# ASCII-animation
Funny animations of symbols combined that form people performing activities like exercising, biking, diving, juggling.
In order to see the website, do the following:
1) Download WAMP (for Windows machines), LAMP (for Linux machines), MAMP (for Macintosh machines)
2) Save all the files from here (my github repository ASCII-animation) in one folder and name it anything you want (for example, "ASCII")
3) Put that "ASCII" folder in the "htdocs" or "www" directory when you open your WAMP, LAMP, MAMP folder
4) Run WAMP/LAMP/MAMP (if the icon is green everything works fine)
5) Open a web browser and type "localhost:8888/ASCII/ascii.html" and you will see the website
6) 8888 is the port number but for your machine it might be different - it could be 80 or 8080
7) Enjoy my website!
